new entries now go to the present file as discussed
[here](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/wiki/Agenda-of-the-April-23rd-2019-meeting-9h30-to-12h30#avoiding-issues-with-changelog).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

- Added tactic `tfae` to split an equivalence between n+1 propositions
  into n+1 goals, and referenced orbitPcycle as a reference of use.

### Changed

- Replaced the legacy generalised induction idiom with a more robust one
that does not rely on the `{-2}` numerical occurrence selector, using
new `ssrnat` helper lemmas `ltn_ind`, `ubnP`, `ubnPleq`,  ...., (see above). The new idiom is documented in `ssrnat`.
   This change anticipates an expected evolution of `fintype` to integrate `finmap`. It is likely that the new definition of the `#|A|` notation will hide multiple occurrences of `A`, which will break the `{-2}` induction idiom. Client libraries should update before the 1.11 release.

- `eqVneq` lemma is changed from `{x = y} + {x != y}` to
  `eq_xor_neq x y (y == x) (x == y)`, on which a case analysis performs
  simultaneous replacement of expressions of the form `x == y` and `y == x`
  by `true` or `false`, while keeping the ability to use it in the way
  it was used before.

- Generalized the `allpairs_catr` lemma to the case where the types of `s`,
  `t1`, and `t2` are non-`eqType`s in `[seq E | i <- s, j <- t1 ++ t2]`.

- Generalized `muln_modr` and `muln_modl` removing hypothesis `0 < p`.

- Generalized `sort` to non-`eqType`s (as well as `merge`,
  `merge_sort_push`, `merge_sort_pop`), together with all the lemmas
  that did not really rely on an `eqType`: `size_merge`, `size_sort`,
  `merge_path`, `merge_sorted`, `sort_sorted`, `path_min_sorted`
  (which statement was modified to remove the dependency in `eqType`),
  and `order_path_min`.

- `compare_nat` type family and `ltngtP` comparison predicate are changed
  from `compare_nat m n (m <= n) (n <= m) (m < n) (n < m) (n == m) (m == n)`
  to `compare_nat m n (n == m) (m == n) (n <= m) (m <= n) (n < m) (m < n)`,
  to make it tries to match subterms with `m < n` first, `m <= n`, then
  `m == n`.
  + The compatibility layer for the version 1.9 is provided as the
    `ssrnat.mc_1_9` module. One may compile proofs compatible with the version
    1.9 in newer versions by using this module.

- Moved `iter_in` to ssrnat and reordered its arguments.

- Notation `[<-> P0 ; .. ; Pn]` now forces `Pi` to be of type `Prop`.

### Removed

- `fin_inj_bij` lemma is removed as a duplicate of `injF_bij` lemma
  from `fintype` library.

### Infrastructure

- `Makefile` now supports the `test-suite` and `only` targets. Currently,
  `make test-suite` will verify the implementation of mathematical structures
  and their inheritances of MathComp automatically, by using the `hierarchy.ml`
  utility. One can use the `only` target to build the sub-libraries of MathComp
  specified by the `TGTS` variable, e.g.,
  `make only TGTS="ssreflect/all_ssreflect.vo fingroup/all_fingroup.vo"`.
